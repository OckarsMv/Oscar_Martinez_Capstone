 H2 production plan analysis

Abstract


An H2 generation plant produces high purity H2 from catalytic reforming of methane with steam, it is necessary to identify the operational variables that most influence production, and predict the largest amount of H2 from these.

One of the most important actions is Data Wrangling because there is no standardized matrix and the data must be downloaded from the control units of the plant.

The unit produces high purity Hydrogen through catalytic reforming of methane gas with high pressure steam. This enters to the reforming furnace and in the presence of the catalyst, the CH4 and H2O molecules are broken, generating CO. CO2, H2 and H2O. The process continues through heat exchange system to reach and absorption process due to pressure differences where the Hydrogen is purified and separated.
